# Overview {#overview}

Every dataset has a history. Understanding these historical origins are crucial for ethically and effectively harnessing datasets to address contemporary social issues. This module teaches students to study data as historical artifacts, exploring examples of how particular datasets have been produced, used, and misused in the past. Learning about the history of data leads to more conscious and ethically-minded data advocacy practice today.

# Learning Outcomes {#outcomes}

Through this module, students will be able to:
- *Approach data as historical artifacts and objects of analysis*
- *Understand how data has been collected, used, and misused within different historical contexts*
- *Analyze the origins and contexts of particular datasets: who, what, when, where, why, and how they were created*
- *Work with tabular data and spreadsheets*

# Key Concepts {#concepts}

Through this module, students will be able to define and consider the **following** concepts:

### Data as Archive

Rather than seeing data as simply a source of quantitative information, this module approaches data as archival documents produced within particular cultural, political, and social moments in time.

### Data Biography

Individual datasets each have a “biography” behind them: the who, when, where, how, and why of a dataset’s creation. This history has implications for how a given dataset should (and shouldn’t) be used today.

### Tabular Data

Tabular data, often stored as spreadsheets, is one of the most common data formats students will encounter. In this module students learn the basics of how tabular data is structured and some basic skills to explore it.

# Assignment {#assignments}

## Data Biography

In this assignment, students apply the concept of a “data biography” to analyze the history behind a particular dataset: the who, what, when, how, and why of the dataset and its creation. In doing so, they learn about the different interpretative filters that shape the historical trajectory of a dataset, from its initial collection to its availability and usability today.
